# ðŸ“Œ Ludivine MOOH
Hello, I'm Ludivine Mooh, a Master's student in Information Security at Pukyong National University. My research interests include : **Post-Quantum Cryptography**, **Embedded devices**, **Secure Software Development** **Multi-Party Computation**

## Portfolio Overview

This repository contains a variety of projects showcasing my **technical skills** across different areas of **security engineering**.  
The projects include **research work, PKI implementations, secure network protocols, system security tools, and security automation scripts**.

### Projects

#### 1. Research & Publications
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):**
  - *Research Focus:* Optimizing ML-KEM implementations for resource-constrained devices.
  - *Publications:* 
    - "ECC Accelerator using Faster Montgomery Ladder on FPGA Devices" â€“ Busan Cyber Security Conference, 2024.
    - "Enhancing ML-KEM Performance using Modular Reduction as Macro" â€“ MITA 2024.
  - *Ongoing Research:* Thesis on optimizing ML-KEM (Kyber) for IoT Devices.

#### 2. PKI Projects
- **RSA PKI:**
  - Demonstrates RSA key generation, encryption, and decryption using OpenSSL in C.
- **ECC PKI:**
  - Implements ECC key generation and digital signature functionality using OpenSSL in C.

#### 3. Protocol Projects
- **TLS/SSL Protocol:**
  - Secure server and client implementations using OpenSSL in C.
  - Includes certificate generation and management for a secure communication channel.

#### 4. System Security Projects
- **File Integrity Monitoring Tool:**
  - A C-based tool that computes SHA-256 hashes (using OpenSSL) to monitor file integrity.
  - Provides both initialization (baseline creation) and checking modes to detect file changes.

#### 5. Security Automation Projects
- **Log Analysis Tool:**
  - A Bash script that scans system authentication logs (e.g., `/var/log/auth.log` or `/var/log/secure`) for suspicious activities like failed login attempts and authentication failures.
  - Automates the detection of potential security issues through log monitoring.

## Build and Usage

Each project contains its own README and Makefile (if applicable) with detailed build and usage instructions. In general:
- **Build:** Navigate to the project directory and run `make` (or compile manually as instructed).
- **Usage:** Follow the instructions in each project's README to run the tools or applications.
- Please note all the codes here are not for deployments.
