# ðŸ“Œ Ludivine MOOH- PQC Optimizations portfolio 

I'm a Master's student in Information Security at Pukyong National University passionate about securing systems in the post-quantum era. My research focuses on **software optimization of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC)** algorithms for resource-constrained devices, addressing the growing need for  security in IoT and embedded systems. I'm particularly interested in bridging the gap between theoretical cryptography and practical implementation, focusing on both performance and security.

This repository contains my current research which is ongoing

### **ðŸ”¹ `code/` Folder - Cryptographic Implementations**

#### `ref`
- **Description:** contains the reference code for ML-KEM with ascon.
- **Status:** ðŸš§ *Work in progress* â€“ Ascon integration is still being optimized for latency but memory improvement can already be seen.

#### `test`
- **Description:** contains all the test for memory, but also validation and integration tests.
- **Includes:** Static memory tracking, RAM usage estimation, and flash size monitoring, latency.

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** These implementations are experimental and part of ongoing research. They are not intended for direct use but serve as a reference for my work.
