## ðŸ“– Research & Publications
### **ðŸ”¹Research Focus**
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Optimizing ML-KEM implementations for resource-constrained devices
- - **Perfomances**: Memory footprint reduction, latency optimizations  

### **ðŸ”¹ Publications**
- **"ECC Accelerator using Faster Montgomery Ladder on FPGA Devices"** - *Busan Cyber Security Conference, 2024*
- **"Enhancing ML-KEM Performance using Modular Reduction as Macro"** - *MITA 2024*

### **ðŸ”¹ Ongoing Research : **Thesis**
- **Optimizing ML-KEM (Kyber) for IoT Devices**: Improving memory efficiency and computational performance by replacing Keccak with Ascon-based primitives.
- **Security & Performance Evaluations**: Evaluating Perfomances, Maintaning security, implemntation on constrained devices i.o RISC V

## ðŸ’» Code Implementations
This repository contains my current research which is ongoing

### **ðŸ”¹ `code/` Folder - Cryptographic Implementations**

#### `ref`
- **Description:** contains the reference code for ML-KEM with ascon.
- **Status:** ðŸš§ *Work in progress* â€“ Ascon integration is still being optimized for latency but memory improvement can already be seen.

#### `test`
- **Description:** contains all the test for memory, but also validation and integration tests.
- **Includes:** Static memory tracking, RAM usage estimation, and flash size monitoring, latency.

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** These implementations are experimental and part of ongoing research. They are not intended for direct use but serve as a reference for my work.
